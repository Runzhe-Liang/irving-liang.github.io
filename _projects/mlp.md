• Created a multi-layer perceptron for frame-level phonetic transcription of raw Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients

• Implemented residual connection and memory-efficient dataset to speed up training process

• Used cosine annealing scheduling, optimizer switching, and ensemble technique to prevent over-fitting and improve
validation accuracy

• Improved speech recognition accuracy by over 20% compared with the baseline model
