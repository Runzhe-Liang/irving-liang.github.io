• Built a fully functional web proxy that can accept, parse, and forward HTTP requests to end servers and fetch relevant
content back to clients

• Used POSIX Threads library to generate threads that serve multiple concurrent requests in parallel

• Constructed a dynamic cache of 1GB to speed up HTTP requests by over 60%, applying mutex to avoid race condition
