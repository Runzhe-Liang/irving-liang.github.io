• Implemented probabilistic inference algorithms to predict the position of hidden ghosts in the classic Pacman game

• Used forward algorithm to conduct exact inference based on Hidden Markov Model

• Improved run-time efficiency for larger games by using approximate inference via particle filtering algorithm
